Automated Processing of SAINT Templated Layouts
===================


APOSTL is an interactive affinity proteomics analysis software developed to reformat affinity proteomics data (both spectral counting and MS1) for input into the SAINTexpress statistical package and to visualize the output(s).  APOSTL was developed at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute and distributed under a GNU General Public License (GPL). APOSTL is built in Python and R and integrated with SAINTexpress into a cohesive affinity proteomics data analysis package using the Galaxy framework.




Installing APOSTL from Galaxy
-------------
The easiest way to get the majority of APOSTL tool is to install them from the galaxy toolshed the instructions for which can be found at https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Tools/AddToolFromToolShedTutorial. The tools can be found at https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/bornea/apostl_tools/6f6e2eb3e81b. 

Most of the tools require an R environment to run. If the R package within galaxy works in your instance feel free to use it but it is not automatically installed when the tools are installed. APOSTL also requires bioconductor packages to be installed, bioconductor packages may require additional linux libraries for installation. In CentOS environments libcurl and xml2lib are required to install bioconductor packages. The script will attempt to install all require R packages automatically but this is imperfect. You may need to make sure that Rscript is your $PATH variable. If the packages are not installed automatically you can enter your R environment and use the following commands in R to install are required packages. 
```R
> install.packages("dplyr", "tidyr", "httr", "jsonlite", "colorRamps", "gplots", "ggrepel", "ggplot2", "data.table", "rcytoscapejs", "stringr", "VennDiagram", "clusterProfiler", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org") 
> source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") 
> biocLite(c('mygene','affy','clusterProfiler','org.Hs.eg.db'))
```


Installing APOSTL Shiny
-------------

Please refer to https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/ for how to install the shiny server on different distributions of linux.
Additional packages libcurl-devel, libxml2-devel, openssl-devel, gsl-devel.x86_64 and libpng-devel will need to be installed (on CentOS installed via yum package manager). The shiny R package must be installed (should be done as part of shiny install).

```R
install.packages('shiny', repos = 'http://cran.r-project.org')
```
Once installed please change the permissions of the /srv/shiny-server directory and the shiny bubble directory should be copied into /srv/shiny-server.

```bash
chmod -R 777 /srv/shiny-server
cp -r ~/APOSTL/shiny_bubble /srv/shiny-server
```
The Shiny tool wrapper python file (APOSTL_Interactive_Analysis.py) and xml wrapper (APOSTL_Interactive_Analysis.xml) needs to be moved into galaxy tools directory. The tool pointer needs to be included in the `galaxy_repo/config/tool_conf.xml` file that is being used by galaxy. It may also be necessary to change the run_as variable in the `/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf` file to the user that runs galaxy. 

Default is to run the shiny server on port 3838 which will need to be open in order to access the APOSTL shiny application. Please edit the APOSTL_Interactive_Analysis.py line 67 to reflect your network configuration. 
```python
x.write("<html><body> open <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:3838/" 
```
> **Note:** This is a hyperlink to the shiny server written by the tool, make sure that the IP or Domain information on this line reflects how the shiny server is accessed. 


APOSTL Docker Image
-------------
The APOSTL Docker Image is a running version of Galaxy, Shiny and all of the APOSTL tools built on a CentOS 7 framework. This image is located at https://hub.docker.com/r/bornea/apostl_shiny/.

Within docker to get the image started use

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 3838:3838 -ti bornea/apostl_shiny /bin/bash
```

The image will be running in interactive mode so you can change information in the /galaxy-apostl-docker/config/galaxy.ini.sample to reflect the network configuration. It is recommended that the galaxy server is started once in the interactive mode.

```bash
cd /galaxy-apostl-docker
sh run.sh
```

Once the startup has completed escape with a Keyboard Interrupt and restart Galaxy in daemon mode and start the shiny server.

```bash
sh run.sh --daemon
sh ./shiny_galaxy_run.sh
```

APOSTL should be accessible from a web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080. If using a non-linux OS then the IP is determined by how the docker virtual machine is set up.
